# Connector Synchronization Worker

Run the API, scheduler, and connector synchronization worker as separate processes. Start the connector worker with `python -m infrastructure.workers.connector_sync_worker_host`; add `--once` for one bounded claim attempt. Production requires database, OpenAI embedding, GitHub App, and Google Secret Manager configuration. Worker identity, lease, heartbeat, polling, shutdown, and expired-recovery bounds use the `CONNECTOR_WORKER_*` settings documented in `GITHUB_CONNECTOR.md`. An entry point does not by itself mean the worker is deployed or monitored.
